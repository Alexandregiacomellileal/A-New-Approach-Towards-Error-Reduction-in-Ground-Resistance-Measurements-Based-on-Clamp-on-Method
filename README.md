# A-New-Approach-Towards-Error-Reduction-in-Ground-Resistance-Measurements-Based-on-Clamp-on-Method
Config files for my GitHub profile.


The first file contains the SBC Wind Park`s grounding system partition to application of proposed method.

The second file contains the grounding electrical circuit of the SBC wind farm.

The third contains the aterrad3.m file, function to calculate the values of the readings to be obtained using the clamp on the cable down to the WTG grounding system, from the values of the impedance of each ground loop and the WTG grounding resistances.

The last file, contains the proposed solution algoritm file that uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the WTG`s grounding resistance through the clamp-on meter readings values. For the ANN to perform as expected, it is trained through computer simulations of the clamp-on meter method on a wind park electrical circuit using the aterrad3 function.

End.
